// fallthrough_middleware.go — Ship D (0.30.141). The HTTP middleware
// that stamps a FallthroughScope onto the request context — the
// pairing of Layer A (fallthrough_ctx.go) with the snowplow HTTP
// surface. Composed into every `/call`-class route in main.go BEFORE
// the dispatcher.
//
// PATTERN. The constructor returns a
// `func(http.Handler) http.Handler` so it slots into the existing
// `chain.Append(...)` shape `plumbing/server/use` already uses for
// `use.UserConfig` (main.go:530-537). Same call-site shape — no new
// middleware infrastructure.
//
// CLOSED-ENUM SCOPE NAMES. The `name` argument is one of the bounded
// scope constants (Scope* below). The constructor validates against
// the enum at boot — an unknown name panics. This is the PM's
// cardinality discipline as code: a future caller can't mint an
// ad-hoc scope name.
//
// WRITE VERBS — PM EXPLICIT. POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE `/call` routes
// ALSO go through the middleware with `call-write-<verb>` scope
// names. Write paths are out of the architectural-consistency
// invariant (they're legitimately apiserver-bound — F-11 in the
// design), but the middleware MUST cover them so:
//
//   - classification is centralized (one boot-assert validates ALL
//     `/call`-class routes, GET and write);
//   - silent escapes are impossible — a future GET-class route
//     accidentally registered as `call-write-*` would still fire
//     the counter (the counter sees the scope label and produces
//     metrics on the wrong cell, immediately visible).
//
// BOOT-ASSERT INTEGRATION. The middleware also records the route's
// scope name in a package-level registry (`routeScopeRegistry`) so
// `AssertReadPathsScoped` (fallthrough_assert.go) can verify every
// registered route is scoped at startup. Without this, a new
// `mux.Handle` line that forgets the middleware would silently bypass
// the invariant.
