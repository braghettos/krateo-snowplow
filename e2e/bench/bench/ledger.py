"""Canonical ledger row builder + report emission (Block 4).

Mix-weighted = 0.95 * cyberjoker + 0.05 * admin (feedback_north_star_is_frontend_ux).
Schema is FROZEN — see source 7109-7133 docstring; the JSON-Schema artifact at
`bench/ledger_row.schema.json` is the machine-readable surface for acceptance (b).

Functions moved (per plan §A.7):
  411-415   record
  411       test_results global  -> _results + add_result/get_results
  7032-7064 _convergence_p99_for_stage  -> convergence_p99_for_stage
  7065-7108 _aggregate_validation       -> aggregate_validation
  7109-7338 _build_canonical_ledger_row -> build_canonical_ledger_row
  7340-7350 _load_per_mutation_metric   -> _load_per_mutation_metric (run_dir-relative now)
  7351-7416 _compute_verdict            -> compute_verdict
  7417-7426 get_runtime_metrics
  8164-8224 print_report
   939-942  pct(data, p)                -> re-exported from bench.cluster.pct

New (Block 4):
  write_run_bundle      — §F directory tree serializer (replaces source 8663-8682)
  compute_verdict_with_falsifier
  emit_ledger_row_schema — writes JSON-Schema 2020-12 covering §F.1 key list
  read_baseline          — read e2e/bench/.baseline.json (acceptance (c))
  compute_baseline_delta — ±15% gate helper (acceptance (c))

Bundle finalize per Task #121 (Diego, 2026-06-10): the 200 MB bundle cap and the
artifact-dropping truncation (#299) are REMOVED. NOTHING is ever dropped from the
run bundle — videos, screenshots, and pod_logs are all retained regardless of total
size — because the final clean re-run is `--video all` at 50K (~1GB+ of video) and
the old cap would trim exactly the videos Diego wants. The only retained behaviour
is the #299 pod_log gzip (S6.txt → S6.txt.gz, ~10-20× smaller): it drops nothing,
only compresses, saving disk while keeping traceability (zcat/zgrep work on the .gz).
`oversize_bundle.json` is now a zero-drop size + gzip-saving report
(`cap_removed: True`, `dropped_count: 0`); summary.json.bundle_truncated is always
False.

Per docs/bench-restructure-path-b-plan-2026-06-02.md §A.7 + §F.

# ─── Latency tier thresholds (ms) ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# warm_p50 (1000) and cold (2200) are the REVISED verdict tiers (Task #121,
# Diego-ratified 2026-06-10; cold re-baselined 2026-06-11 — see below). They are NOT north-star: 500ms warm / 1000ms cold
# remain the ASPIRATIONAL frontend-scope target (documented below, NOT deleted).
# These verdict tiers are set to the measured-achievable floor under the
# snowplow+chart control surface, because the warm/cold tiers are STRUCTURALLY
# UNREACHABLE within that scope — proved, not assumed (per
# feedback_north_star_is_desiderata: "relax ONLY when data proves a structural
# limit — the data now proves it"; derivation, not a magic number, per
# feedback_capacity_caps_empirical_per_entry_cost):
#
#   STRUCTURAL PROOF (warm/cold are frontend-gated, not server-gated):
#   - docs/task-288-lane1-measurement-2026-06-10.md: per-call snowplow server
#     compute is sub-millisecond (warm serve stack <1% CPU; the ~914ms warm
#     PAGE p50 is the SPA fetch waterfall = wave-count × per-wave browser↔ingress
#     RTT + render — a FAN-OUT problem on the frontend, NOT server overhead).
#   - docs/task-300-c1-fanout-collapse-design-2026-06-10.md: C1 (the only chart
#     lever, /compositions fan-out collapse) is INFEASIBLE without a frontend JS
#     change (W2+W3 per-card/child fetch is the content-fill mechanism the SPA
#     insists on issuing; verdict D: "warm floor stands at ~908ms"). The residual
#     is frontend/ingress, out of the snowplow+chart scope.
#
#   TIER DERIVATION (measured-achievable floor × run-variance headroom):
#   - warm_p50 measured across 3 clean 50K runs = 914 (0.30.251 run3) /
#     908 (0.30.253) / 890 (0.30.254). Tier 1000 = ~1.09× worst-observed (914),
#     i.e. run-variance headroom over the worst clean run.
#   - cold measured across the same 3 runs = 1196 / 1185 / 1175. Tier 1300 =
#     ~1.09× worst-observed (1196), same headroom basis.
#   - cold RE-BASELINED 1300 -> 2200 (Diego-ratified 2026-06-11): the bench
#     cold METHODOLOGY changed — per-stage lazy recording contexts + the
#     fresh-login two-window flow (commits e6feee1 / 8a69848) start the cold
#     navigation from a colder browser state than the pre-#304 flow did.
#     Mix-weighted cold across the clean 50K validations under the CURRENT
#     methodology = 2043 / 2052 / ~2070 (0.30.255-0.30.257), while warm_p50
#     stayed FLAT (~911 vs the 890-914 band) — proving the shift is the
#     measurement methodology, not a serve-path regression. Tier 2200 =
#     ~1.06× worst-observed (~2070), same headroom basis as #121. The old
#     1300 applies only to pre-methodology rows; 1000 stays aspirational.
#
# CONV_TIER_MS = 30000 is the 50K-scale REVISED convergence tier (Task #289,
# Diego-ratified 2026-06-10). The prior 1000ms tier is structurally
# unreachable at 50K — proved, not assumed (per feedback_north_star_is_desiderata:
# "relax only when data proves structural limit"):
#   - docs/task-282-serve-stale-depth-trace-2026-06-10.md §1: a single
#     compositions-panels LIST re-resolve costs 11.5s p50 / 52.8s p99 at 50K
#     (krateo-system/blueprints-panels: n=57, p50=11,535ms, p99=52,753ms), and
#   - the VERIFY poll cadence imposes a ~22-24s floor observed across every
#     run: convergence_mass_s8_p99 ≈ 23.8s measured (run-20260609-221611,
#     run-20260609-234201, and the prior 0.30.248 run-20260605-114100 all sit
#     in the 22-24s band).
# 30000ms covers the measured ~23.8s p99 + margin. This is the eventually-
# consistent serve-stale contract at scale; #286 (fast-lane) may allow
# tightening this tier later.
