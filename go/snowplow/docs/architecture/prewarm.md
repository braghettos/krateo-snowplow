# Prewarm

How snowplow makes the *first* page-load warm: it replays the frontend's own
navigation under the service-account identity at boot, populates the informer
set and the per-binding L1 cache, and keeps those cells fresh as objects change —
without ever hardcoding a navigation path, a cohort list, or a GVR.

This is a maintainer deep-dive. It leads with the flow, then traces the named
files, then states the invariants and the known failure modes. Re-derived from
the current tree (docs-standard, 2026-08-06); anchors are file + function names.

## Trace

### One knob: the whole prewarm family is implicit-on-cache

There is **no prewarm env flag any more**. The formerly-standalone gates —
`PREWARM_ENABLED`, `PREWARM_CONTENT_ENABLED`, `PREWARM_PIP_ENABLED`,
`PREWARM_ENGINE_ENABLED`, `PROACTIVE_RA_SEED_ENABLED` — are **retired**: each
helper now returns `cache.PrewarmEnabled()` (== cache on), and a stale value in
the environment is ignored with a one-shot audit log (`cache/retired_flags.go`;
`=false` logs a WARN because the operator asked for OFF and now gets ON).
The legacy `runPIPSeed` global-cohort seed path is **deleted**
(`prewarm_engine_boot.go`); the engine is the only seed path. Back-out for the
whole family is `CACHE_ENABLED=false`, which nils the harvesters and makes the
walk/seed a no-op.

### Boot seed — the only hardcoded GVRs

`phase1WarmupWith` (`internal/handlers/dispatchers/phase1_walk.go`) is the boot
orchestrator. **Step 1** is the entire "boot seed": `rw.RegisterMetaQuerySeeds()`
(`internal/cache/phase1.go`) registers only the bare meta-query anchors —
*"every business GVR is discovered by resolution"*. Ship 0/0.5 deleted the
`customresourcedefinitions` seed and the CRD informer entirely; composition
GVRs are discovered as a synchronous side-effect of the walk
(`cache.DiscoverGroupResources`), not pre-seeded.

### Phase-1 walker roots — read from the frontend ConfigMap, not hardcoded

The roots are NOT `navmenus` / `routesloaders` literals. **Step 3** calls the
lister, which is `listNavigationRootsFromConfigMap` (`phase1_roots.go`). It:

1. Reads the frontend ConfigMap — name from env `FRONTEND_CONFIG_CONFIGMAP`
   (default `frontend-config-vars`), namespace = `AUTHN_NAMESPACE`.
2. Parses its `config.json` key, reading `.api.INIT` and `.api.ROUTES_LOADER` —
   the two `/call?...` URLs the frontend itself dispatches on login.
3. Decodes each URL into an `ObjectReference` via
   `objects.ParseCallPathToObjectRef` — the same generic `/call` decoder the
   recursive walk uses; not a path special-case.
4. Fetches each named root widget CR via `objects.Get` and returns
   `navigationRoot{Root, GVR}` pairs.

The strings `navmenus`/`routesloaders` appear **nowhere** as Go literals driving
root selection. If the frontend changes its INIT widget, Phase 1 follows with
zero Go change.

**A missing ConfigMap is self-healing, not just degraded.** When snowplow boots
before the frontend (fresh-install boot race), the eager read finds nothing; the
warmup logs `phase1.warmup.roots_list_failed`, proceeds through the sync barrier
and the normal readiness flip — and a dedicated single-object ConfigMap informer
(`phase1_configvars_watch.go`, registered on the process-lifetime ctx) enqueues
a `scopeKindBoot` re-walk the instant the ConfigMap appears or its
`config.json` data changes (a data-change gate ignores metadata-only churn such
as CDC traceparent re-stamps). The re-drive works before OR after the readiness
backstop, with zero pod restart.

### The recursive walk — replaying navigation, GET-only

**Step 4** calls `resolve(ctx, root)` per root, which threads into
`phase1Walker.walk()` (`phase1_walk.go`). Per walked widget:

- `harvestApiRef` + `harvestNavWidget` collect the widget's apiRef RESTAction
  and the widget CR + its (GVR, pagination) tuple into the shared harvesters the
  engine seed later drains.
- `widgets.Resolve` runs the widget under the SA identity; its inner-call walk
  auto-registers an informer per touched GVR and invokes
  `cache.DiscoverGroupResources` for templated apiserver paths.
- It reads `status.resourcesRefs.items[]` — the child widget endpoints — via
  `extractResourcesRefsItems`.

**The recursion gate is `verb == "GET"` only.** Before descending into a child,
the loop calls `walkShouldRecurse(child)`, which is exactly:

```go
func walkShouldRecurse(child navChildRef) bool {
    return strings.EqualFold(child.Verb, "GET") && child.Path != ""
}
```

This is load-bearing for both correctness and safety: a non-GET
`resourcesRefs` item is a mutation/action endpoint (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
bound to a widget's `actions`, and because the walk runs with the SA's
*privileged* credentials, following one would issue a destructive apiserver
mutation. The `allowed` RBAC flag is **deliberately not** a recursion gate:
Phase 1 is identity-independent informer *discovery*; the per-user `allowed`
render gate is applied later, at real request time. Recursion bounds are the
visited-set and `phase1MaxWalkDepth`; child fan-out is bounded by the declared
`slice` or `prewarmPageLimit()`.

### The sync barrier

After the walk, `settleRegisteredSet` (Step 6) waits for the discovered
informer set to stop growing, then `WaitAllInformersSynced` (Step 7,
`cache/phase1.go`) blocks until every registered informer `HasSynced` AND no
new informer appeared during the wait (the re-snapshot loop).

### Readiness gates on prewarm-complete (the 2026-07-02 reversal)

This is the part that **reversed** relative to older revisions of this doc.
The per-cohort seed used to run in the background *after* `MarkPhase1Done`
("readiness precedes the seed; boot is cohort-count-independent"). Empirically,
an informer-synced-but-cold pod serializes/503s the compositions-page fan-out
under the aggregate-OOM admission gate — "synced ≠ safe to route". So the seed
now runs **synchronously at Step 7.6, before `MarkPhase1Done`** (shape A,
`docs/readiness-gate-prewarm-complete-2026-07-02.md`), and `/readyz` gates on
prewarm-complete:

- `engineSeed` (`phase1_walk.go`) starts the engine on the **process-lifetime
  ctx** (`SetEngineProcessContext`, wired from `main.go` — the fix for the
  worker dying at boot-scope completion), enqueues one `scopeKindBoot`, and
  waits on the **first** of:
  - the **first-nav latch** (`prewarm_first_nav_latch.go`): fires the instant
    every cohort's **nav widgets** have seeded (or provably has none) — the
    happy path. Ready flips with every cohort's navigation warm while the boot
    scope keeps seeding the RESTAction content tail in background.
  - `bootDone` — the boot scope finished/failed before the latch could fire
    (e.g. roots-list failure); a genuine boot error still surfaces.
  - the `pipGlobalTimeout` / `PHASE1_TIMEOUT` backstop.
- `MarkPhase1Done` is a **defer placed before the seed call**, so it fires on
  every exit — normal return, error, timeout, even a seed panic (the recover
  runs first). Readiness is therefore **never withheld forever**; a failed or
  timed-out seed flips the pod **Ready-degraded** and the failure is surfaced
  loudly (`recordReadinessBackstop` → `snowplow_readyz_backstop_fired` +
  ERROR logs — the F5 "backstop-Ready is an explicit failure signal" ship).
- With prewarm off entirely (cache off), a nil seed flips Ready right after the
  sync barrier — the byte-identical no-seed behaviour.

**Step 7.7** — the deferred apiRef pagination drain — runs *after* the flip on
a bounded background goroutine (page 2..N of paginated apiRef widgets, plus the
post-storm re-collection pass); it fills widgetContent page cells without
blocking `/readyz`.

### The seed — one dynamic engine, rank-major and class-interleaved

The engine worker (`prewarm_engine.go`) yields to any in-flight customer
`/call` before and during each scope (`yieldToCustomer`,
`engineYieldCheckpoint`) and runs `rePrewarmBoot` (`prewarm_engine_boot.go`):

1. **RE-WALK both roots with a FRESH `phase1Walker` per root** (new visited
   map). This is the boot-race fix: the Step-4 walk runs *before* the sync
   barrier and is single-pass, so the navmenu's *dynamic* children
   (`resourcesRefsTemplate` over the apiRef) resolve to 0 while fallthrough
   data is empty. The re-walk runs *after* the barrier, when the data is
   present, so the full nav tree is discovered and the harvesters are
   populated. Reusing the old visited map would short-circuit and descend
   nothing. (F4b Lever B additionally reuses the boot discovery snapshot on a
   resume re-walk, and Lever A marks declined-external targets so a resume does
   not re-resolve external whales in a loop.)
2. `settleRegisteredSet` once.
3. `cache.BuildBindingsByGVRIndex(rw.RegisteredGVRs())` — the cohort-scoping
   substrate, built over the *navigated* GVRs.
4. `seedScopeYielding` drains the harvested widgets + restactions and seeds the
   per-binding top-level L1 cells, in a **rank-major, class-interleaved**
   order: identities are ranked widget-capable-first (deterministic rank
   hygiene over both classes' target sets — Fix-3), and for each rank the
   widgets seed in first-nav walk order, then that rank's RESTActions (cheap
   RAs first by target count). The F3 login-cohort coverage work makes every
   login-cohort-shaped identity reachable (with an intended ServiceAccount
   exclusion), and the all-nav-widget latch (F3b-r2) is what feeds the
   first-nav readiness latch above. A per-seed-pass RA-resolve memo
   (`cache/seed_resolve_memo.go`, F4) dedups repeated RA resolves within one
   pass.

Seed-unit resource use is bounded adaptively: `seed_bound.go` applies the
shared `cache.AdmissionCeiling()` headroom gate (GOMEMLIMIT − live heap −
reserve) at the `seedOneWidget` / `seedOneRestaction` choke points — a separate
semaphore instance from the nested-resolve bound so the stacked seed→nested
case cannot deadlock. External fetches inside the boot seed carry a wall-clock
bound (`api/external_seed_bound.go`). The error-aware Put-gate declines a
degraded re-resolve rather than overwrite a good warm entry.

### The cohort model — dynamic, no static list, no cold-fill

`seedScopeYielding` does **not** iterate a cohort list. For each harvested
widget it scopes on the widget's GVR; for each harvested RESTAction it scopes
on the RA's *target* GVR derived from its `userAccessFilter`
(`restActionTargetGVR`). It then asks the **live index** for the per-binding
targets via `cache.EnumeratePrewarmTargetsForGVR(gvr, "list")`
(`cache/prewarm_enumeration.go`). Each authorising RBAC binding yields exactly
one `PrewarmTarget`; the representative subject identity is drawn from the
binding's subjects.

Three "no static / no cold-fill" facts, verified in code:

- **No static cohort list.** Targets are read from `BindingsByGVR` per
  snapshot; there is no Go-literal cohort set.
- **No global fallback.** The v3 `EnumerateBindingSetClasses()` global-cohort
  fallback was **removed**. When the per-GVR enumerator returns empty (no
  authorising binding, or the target GVR is runtime-discovered), the seed
  **skips** that GVR rather than widening to a universe of identities that
  can't authorise it.
- **No lazy cold-fill.** A skipped target is not back-filled by a background
  job; runtime-discovered RA targets are resolved cold-then-warm via the
  on-demand dispatcher at first `/call`.

An empty-`BindingUID` target is never seeded (`prewarm_seed_empty_binding_skip`
— the #95 leak closure), and the seed Puts stamp `RBACSubGen==0` (a known
warm-miss for subjects whose sub-generation has moved; dispatch keys stay
correct).

Customer priority is enforced throughout: `engineYieldCheckpoint(ctx)` runs
between every target, so a customer burst arriving mid-seed defers the
remaining work.

### Steady state — three re-prewarm mechanisms

1. **Existing cells stay fresh via the refresher (object CRUD).** An informer
   ADD/UPDATE event calls `DepTracker.OnAdd`/`OnUpdate` → `onChange`
   (`internal/cache/deps.go`), which dirty-marks every dependent L1 key
   (exact-object + LIST-scope deps) into the refresher. The refresher
   **re-resolves** the entry — never evicts on ADD/UPDATE. DELETE evicts only
   the deleted object's own self entry and dirty-marks its dependents. Each
   refresher commit publishes a `/refreshes` SSE signal.
2. **New navigation structure via the engine (CRD/GVR CRUD).** When a genuinely
   new GVR is first registered post-boot, the cache fires its GVR-discovered
   hook (`cache.RegisterGVRDiscoveredHook`), which the engine wires at start to
   enqueue a `scopeKindGVRDiscovered` scope. That scope runs the same
   re-walk + seed core; re-reading the now-widened index records the dep edge
   against the new GVR, so subsequent CR events propagate via the normal
   `onChange` → dirty-mark → refresher path. The queue keys distinct GVRs as
   distinct work and coalesces repeats.
3. **Quiet cells via the keepwarm sweep (#102).** A cell whose data goes quiet
   dies at TTL by design (CreatedAt slides only on Put; there is no store
   janitor), so a >TTL-returning user would pay a full cold resolve. A ticker
   (`prewarm_keepwarm_sweep.go`) enqueues `scopeKindKeepwarm` at **TTL×3/4**
   (derived from `RESOLVED_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` — no new env knob);
   `rePrewarmKeepwarm` re-runs the walk + seed for the **widget-capable prefix
   of the identity ranking** (every login-cohort-shaped identity — the c2
   coverage fix), with an age-skip for still-fresh cells. Each sweep Put
   re-resolves fresh bytes (never TTL-extends), preserving the staleness
   backstop by construction; the queue coalesces to at most one pending sweep.

The placeholder scope kinds `scopeKindWidgetCR` / `scopeKindRBACShift` are
**declared but not wired** (`prewarm_engine.go`): a widget/RESTAction *CR*
add/update/delete does not enqueue an engine re-walk of its subtree. Today such
changes are caught by the refresher (for already-cached dependent keys) and by
lazy resolve-on-navigation at `/call`.

---

## Invariants

- **No special cases / no hardcoded navigation.** The only hardcoded GVRs at
  boot are the meta-query seeds. Navigation roots, the cohort set, and every
  business GVR are read from config / the live RBAC index / the walk — never Go
  literals.
- **The walk is strictly read-only.** Recursion is gated on `verb == "GET"`
  alone (`walkShouldRecurse`); the SA's privileged credentials never reach a
  mutation endpoint.
- **Discovery is identity-independent; rendering is not.** `allowed` is never a
  recursion gate during prewarm. The per-user `allowed` render verdict is
  re-derived at request time — prewarmed SA-evaluated `allowed=true` flags are
  never served verbatim.
- **Readiness gates on prewarm-complete, with a fire-regardless backstop.**
  `/readyz` flips 200 at min(first-nav-warm, seed-complete, backstop); a
  failed/stuck/panicking seed yields **Ready-degraded** (loudly surfaced via
  `snowplow_readyz_backstop_fired`), never not-Ready-forever. This *reverses*
  the earlier "readiness precedes the seed" design — boot wall-clock is no
  longer cohort-count-independent by construction; the latch + backstops bound
  it instead.
- **The re-walk MUST use a fresh visited map and the same `walk()`.** Reusing
  the boot pass's visited set descends nothing.
- **Customer `/call` has absolute priority.** Both the engine worker and the
  steady-state refresher yield on `customerInFlight()`.
- **The whole feature is toggle-off-able — via `CACHE_ENABLED` only.** The
  per-stage prewarm envs are retired; setting one is ignored (audited). The
  seed's memory use is bounded by the shared adaptive admission ceiling, not by
  capacity knobs.

## Known failure modes

- **Pre-sync single-pass dynamic-children miss (the boot-race).** The Step-4
  walk runs before the sync barrier, so a navmenu whose children are
  `resourcesRefsTemplate`-driven sees empty fallthrough data and harvests only
  the roots. *Mitigation:* the engine's post-barrier re-walk (always on).
- **Missing / late frontend ConfigMap.** No longer a permanent cold pod: the
  config-vars informer re-drives `scopeKindBoot` when the ConfigMap appears or
  its data changes, before or after the readiness backstop, no restart.
  Until then, lazy register-on-navigation covers GVRs on first request.
- **Ready-degraded boot.** A seed error, `pipGlobalTimeout`/`PHASE1_TIMEOUT`
  expiry, or a seed panic flips readiness with cold cells;
  `snowplow_readyz_backstop_fired` (+ `readyz.backstop.fired` ERROR) is the
  signal. First `/call` per affected cohort falls back to per-user resolve.
- **Engine worker lifetime.** The worker is bound to the process-lifetime ctx
  via `SetEngineProcessContext` — binding it to the boot-seed ctx (the 0.30.247
  regression) would drop post-boot `scopeKindGVRDiscovered`/keepwarm work.
- **Six HARD REVERTs from a missing `rc` field.** A `phase1Walker` struct
  literal that omitted `rc` (the SA `*rest.Config`) fail-closed at
  `discoverPluralInfo`. *Fix:* `newPhase1Walker` makes `rc` a required
  positional parameter (`phase1_walker_new.go`).
- **Empty per-GVR index → skipped seed.** If `BuildBindingsByGVRIndex` runs
  before the RBAC snapshot is ready, or a navigated GVR has no authorising
  binding, `EnumeratePrewarmTargetsForGVR` returns nil and the seed skips that
  GVR by design. Those targets fall back to cold-then-warm at first `/call` —
  never to a global-cohort universe (that fallback was an RBAC-leak risk and
  was removed).
- **Transient apiserver pressure during seed.** An operational (non-RBAC-deny)
  per-target seed failure re-enqueues a single coalesced `scopeKindBoot` to
  retry after pressure clears (`phase1_seed_classify.go`); the F.4 boot-scope
  resume chunks the re-walk with a fresh-skip so a deadline-cut pass resumes
  instead of restarting, and the re-enqueue is bounded against deterministic
  seed failures (no infinite redrive). RBAC-deny failures are expected and not
  retried.
- **External whales.** Boot-seed external fetches are wall-clock-bounded, and
  declined-external markers (F4b Lever A) stop a resume loop from re-resolving
  the same external target; an external RA is never L1-cached anyway (see
  caching.md §4) unless TTL-annotated.
- **Widget/RESTAction CR edits do not re-walk their subtree (gap, not bug).**
  `scopeKindWidgetCR`/`scopeKindRBACShift` are declared but unwired; such edits
  are covered only by the refresher (cached dependents) and lazy
  resolve-on-navigation until a future ship wires them.
