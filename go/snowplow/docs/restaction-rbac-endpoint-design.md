# Snowplow `/rbac` endpoint — RESTAction→GVR inspect-only enumeration (REVISED design)

Date: 2026-06-23
Anchor: canonical `~/krateo/snowplow-cache/snowplow` @ `1.4.3-1-g4062db0`.
Status: REVISED per PM gate (REVISE) + Diego auth ruling. Doc-only; no code in this pass.
Supersedes the prior finalized design on exactly two premises (Corrections 1 and 2 below);
everything else is carried forward verbatim (PM-blessed).

> Note for §4 / §7.1 of the prior draft: the directive "omit the UAF stages from the
> enumerated read-set" is **REVERSED** — UAF stages are **EMITTED** (with their verb).
> See Correction 1.

## 0. Purpose

core-provider needs to know, for a given RESTAction, the full set of
`(group, resource, verb)` tuples that resolving it will read — so it can pre-generate
the RBAC (Roles/RoleBindings) a user needs *before* the first `/call`. `/rbac` enumerates
that read-set from the RA's `api[]` stages **without dispatching** (no apiserver reads of
the referenced data, no per-user creds required) and returns a canonical, deduped,
sorted list.

---

## 1. Prior-art check (k8s / client-go)

- `SelfSubjectRulesReview` (authorization/v1) enumerates what *a caller* may do, not what a
  *RESTAction* will read — wrong axis. We need the RA's static read-set, derived from the
  blueprint, before any binding exists.
- `RESTMapper` / discovery (`discoveryClientFor`, discovery_dispatch.go:114) maps
  group/version → resource plurals; we **reuse** it (already in-process). It does not, on its
  own, walk an RA's `api[]` + `dependsOn` graph — that walk is snowplow-specific.
- No client-go primitive walks a snowplow RA blueprint. So the *enumeration* is new; every
  *primitive it calls* is existing snowplow code (§3). Nothing reinvented.

---

## 2. Root-axis facts (all TRACED against the anchor)

| Fact | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP-stage `self.verb` is CEL-bound to GET/HEAD (case-insensitive) | `apis/templates/v1/core.go:30` | TRACED |
| `self.userAccessFilter.verb` is **only** CEL-required non-empty — NOT member-bound | `apis/templates/v1/core.go:32` | TRACED |
| `UserAccessFilterSpec.Verb` is a **free-form lower-case string** ("get, list, watch, etc.") | `apis/templates/v1/core.go:139-141` | TRACED |
| refilter passes `Verb: uaf.Verb` **verbatim** into `EvaluateRBAC` | `internal/resolvers/restactions/api/refilter.go:257-267` (line 260) | TRACED |
| `/call` mounts on `middleware.UserConfig(*signKey, *authnNS)` | `main.go:813-814` | TRACED |
| `UserConfig` = JWT-validate (authn) + load `<user>-clientconfig` Endpoint into ctx | `internal/handlers/middleware/userconfig.go:151,229-233` | TRACED |
| `/refreshes` mounts WITHOUT `RegisterScopedRoute` (zero apiserver reads → outside read-path-scoped invariant) | `main.go:825,831-833` | TRACED |
| `RegisterScopedRoute` is what enrolls a route in the per-user apiserver-read scope invariant | `internal/cache/fallthrough_middleware.go:142-158` | TRACED |
| Enumeration primitives all exist in-process | topologicalSort `sort.go:9`; ParseAPIServerPathToDep `internal/cache/inventory.go:251`; discoveryClientFor `discovery_dispatch.go:114`; createRequestOptions `setup.go:28`; `ServiceAccountRESTConfig` `internal/dynamic/sa_client.go:158` | TRACED |

---

## 3. Reuse map — KEPT UNCHANGED (PM-blessed)

The enumeration body is unchanged from the prior finalized design:

- **No-dispatch path-eval**: `createRequestOptions(ctx, log, in, dict)` (`setup.go:28`) resolves a
  stage's `path` from the (possibly empty) dict WITHOUT issuing the HTTP/apiserver call —
  use it to materialize each stage's concrete path, then classify.
- **Path → GVR**: `ParseAPIServerPathToDep(path)` (`inventory.go:251`) yields
  `(gvr, namespace, name, ok)` for an in-cluster apiserver-shaped path.
- **Discovery**: `discoveryClientFor(rc)` (`discovery_dispatch.go:114`) on
  `ServiceAccountRESTConfig()` (`sa_client.go:158`) resolves bare `/apis/<g>/<v>` discovery-shaped
  stages to their resource plural set — **SA discovery, dispatch-free**.
- **Dependency order**: `topologicalSort(items)` (`sort.go:9`) — **corrected location** (prior
  draft mis-cited `resolve.go:1480`). Used to evaluate `dependsOn` edges in order so a
  stage's path that templates off an upstream stage's (empty-dict) output is still walkable.
- **dependsOn cutoff**: empty-dict eval + parser rejection — a path that cannot be
  materialized from the empty dict (because it genuinely needs upstream *data*, not just
  shape) is reported, not silently dropped.
- **Permissive default**, **fail-loud non-200 enumeration**, **canonical dedupe/sort**: unchanged.
- **Zero dispatch-path modification**: `/rbac` is a read-only sibling endpoint; it does not
  touch `Resolve`, the dispatcher, or the refilter.

The ~280-LOC sketch is carried forward **minus the ServiceAuth middleware** (see Correction 2):
`serviceauth.go` is **dropped**; `/rbac` mounts on the existing `UserConfig`.

## 4. Correction 1 — UAF stages are EMITTED (with their verb); they are NOT omitted

### Root cause of the prior error (TRACED)
The prior draft asserted "CRD CEL restricts `userAccessFilter.verb` to get/head/list, so a
verb-less response is provably safe, and UAF stages can be omitted from the read-set." That is
**FALSE**:
- `core.go:30` bounds **`self.verb`** — the *HTTP stage method* — to GET/HEAD.
- `core.go:32` only requires **`self.userAccessFilter.verb != ''`** (non-empty); it does **not**
  constrain it to any member set.
- `core.go:139-141`: `UserAccessFilterSpec.Verb` is a free-form lower-case string
  ("get, list, watch, etc.").
- `refilter.go:260`: the refilter calls `EvaluateRBAC(Verb: uaf.Verb, …)` **verbatim**.

So `uaf.Verb` can be `watch`, `deletecollection`, or anything else. A verb-less `/rbac`
response paired with a consumer that grants only a fixed `{get,list,watch}` read-set would
**UNDER-GRANT** any UAF stage whose verb falls outside that set → silent under-read at first
`/call`. The "CEL guarantees it" claim is **struck entirely**.

### Fix — emit `uaf.Verb` on UAF rows (PM-preferred)
A UAF stage contributes a read-set row carrying its **own** verb so the consumer grants
exactly that verb. The verb the SA-dispatch+refilter actually checks is `uaf.Verb`
(refilter.go:260) on `(uaf.Group, resource∈resolveUAFResources)` — that is precisely what
the user must hold, so that is precisely what we emit.

### Response shape (build-ready)

```json
{
  "restaction": { "name": "compositions-get-ns-and-crd", "namespace": "krateo-system" },
  "readSet": [
    { "group": "",                         "resource": "namespaces",     "verb": "get" },
    { "group": "apiextensions.k8s.io",     "resource": "customresourcedefinitions", "verb": "list" },
    { "group": "composition.krateo.io",    "resource": "fireworksapps",  "verb": "watch" }
  ],
  "unresolved": [
    { "stage": "detail", "reason": "path templates off upstream stage data; not materializable from empty dict" }
  ]
}
```

Field rules (the digest/dedupe key is the full triple, so this stays stable):

- **`verb` is ALWAYS present** on every row. This is the deliberate, documented divergence
  from chart-inspector byte-parity, and it is the entire correctness point of Correction 1.
- **Non-UAF rows** (plain in-cluster stages, classified via `ParseAPIServerPathToDep`)
  carry the verb dictated by the path SHAPE: a **COLLECTION** read
  (`.../resource`, no object name) → **`"list"`**; a **BY-NAME** read
  (`.../resource/<name>`) → **`"get"`**. ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-25, #44 verb bug):
  the prior draft asserted a *constant* `"get"` on the (mistaken) rationale that
  "`core.go:30` bounds the HTTP-stage method to GET/HEAD, so `get` is exact". That
  conflated the HTTP *method* with the RBAC *verb*: the apiserver authorizes a
  collection GET under the **`list`** verb, so a constant `get` UNDER-GRANTED every
  collection stage (the dominant catalog shape, e.g. the `/blueprints`
  `compositiondefinitions` LIST) and 403'd the real LIST at `/call`. The fix
  (`inspect.go` `inspectInClusterStage`) captures the object `name` from
  `ParseAPIServerPathToDep` and emits `verb := "list"; if name != "" { verb = "get" }`.
  Resource granularity is unchanged — `Resource.Name` stays `""` (a resource-level
  grant, per §3.2); only the verb reflects the read shape.
- **UAF rows** carry **`uaf.Verb`** verbatim (the value at `core.go:141`, passed at
  refilter.go:260). For a `resourcesFrom` UAF the row fans out to one row per discovered
  plural (each with the same `uaf.Verb` and `uaf.Group`), matching the OR-semantics loop at
  refilter.go:254-285.

> Prior-draft note: a "verb-less response with chart-inspector byte-parity" is **abandoned**.
> Byte-parity on the *non-UAF* subset is preserved only at the (group, resource) level;
> the always-present `verb` field is an additive, documented field on the snowplow response.
> The consumer (core-provider) keys on the triple.

### Dedupe / sort (unchanged mechanism, now over the triple)
Canonical-dedupe and -sort operate on `(group, resource, verb)` lexicographically. Two stages
that read the same resource under different verbs (e.g. an HTTP-GET stage on `namespaces` and
a UAF `watch` on `namespaces`) yield **two** distinct rows — correct, because the user needs
both verbs granted.

### Falsifier (PM-required)
Construct an RA with a UAF stage whose `uaf.Verb` ∉ {get,list,watch} — e.g.
`userAccessFilter: { verb: deletecollection, group: "", resource: namespaces }` (admission
accepts it: `core.go:32` only checks non-empty + XOR). Call `/rbac`. **PASS** iff the
`readSet` contains exactly `{ "group": "", "resource": "namespaces", "verb": "deletecollection" }`.
A verb-less or omitted row = FAIL (the under-grant the prior design would have produced).

---

## 5. Correction 2 — `/rbac` REUSES the existing `UserConfig` auth (no new ServiceAuth)

### Root cause of the prior error
The prior draft invented a dedicated-key `ServiceAuth` middleware (`serviceauth.go`) on the
premise that core-provider arrives **unauthenticated**. Diego confirms that premise is FALSE:
**core-provider already presents the standard `/call` auth** (a JWT + a `<user>-clientconfig`).
So no new middleware and no new signing key.

### Fix — mount `/rbac` on `middleware.UserConfig(*signKey, *authnNS)`
Identical to `/call` (`main.go:813-814`). Concretely, mount in the same block:

```go
// GET /rbac — RESTAction read-set enumeration for core-provider RBAC pre-gen.
// Authenticated with the SAME JWT+clientconfig as /call (middleware.UserConfig).
// DELIBERATELY NOT cache.RegisterScopedRoute'd: like /refreshes (main.go:831-833),
// it issues ZERO per-user apiserver reads — enumeration runs under SA discovery —
// so it sits outside the read-path-scoped invariant (fallthrough_middleware.go:142).
mux.Handle("GET /rbac", chain.Append(
    middleware.UserConfig(*signKey, *authnNS)).
    Then(handlers.RBAC( /* deps: SA rest.Config + RA lookup */ )))
```

### The load-bearing framing: authentication ≠ the caller's RBAC permissions (TRACED)
This is the point to get exactly right:

- `UserConfig` does two things (userconfig.go): (a) **validate the JWT** → `userInfo`
  (`:151`); (b) **load `<user>-clientconfig`** Endpoint into ctx via `WithUserConfig`
  (`:229-233`). (a) is authentication. (b) is the per-user dispatch *capability*.
- `/rbac` consumes **(a) only** for the authn gate. It does **NOT** use (b): the enumeration
  reads nothing through the caller's clientconfig — discovery runs under
  `ServiceAccountRESTConfig()` (`sa_client.go:158`). Loading the clientconfig is **harmless**:
  core-provider has one, and `/rbac` simply never dispatches with it.
- Therefore `/rbac` needs **NONE of the caller's RBAC permissions** → the read-set can be
  generated **before** the first resolve / before any binding exists. This is the whole reason
  the endpoint exists, and it survives the auth-reuse: requiring a JWT for *authentication* is
  orthogonal to needing the caller's *permissions*.
- Loading the clientconfig is a Secret read served from the informer cache
  (`api.FromInformerSecret`, userconfig.go:169) — **not** a per-user apiserver RBAC read.
  This is why `/rbac` stays correctly **un-`RegisterScopedRoute`'d** (mirrors `/refreshes`,
  whose comment at main.go:824-826 states the same "zero apiserver reads → outside the
  invariant" rationale).

### Privileged-oracle tradeoff (addressed, not over-engineered)
With `UserConfig`, **any** authenticated caller (any holder of a valid JWT + clientconfig) can
call `/rbac` and learn a RESTAction's GVR read-set. That is **read-only metadata** about a
blueprint; it confers no access — the actual privilege (writing RBAC) lives in core-provider,
not in `/rbac`. The data leaked is "which GVRs does RA X read", which is already discoverable
by anyone who can `GET` the RESTAction CR. **Accepted tradeoff; default is plain `UserConfig`
per Diego.**

**OPTIONAL hardening (offered, not default):** if `/rbac` should be restricted to
core-provider specifically, the minimal add is a caller-identity/group check inside
`handlers.RBAC` — gate on the core-provider SA's group (`system:serviceaccounts:<ns>` or its
specific SA username from `userInfo`, already in ctx from `WithUserInfo`). ~5 LOC, no new
middleware. Recommendation: **ship plain `UserConfig`** (Diego's ruling); add the group check
later only if a concrete need to restrict the oracle appears.

---

## 6. LOC bound & file:line targets

- `internal/handlers/rbac.go` (**new**, ~180 LOC): `func RBAC(...) http.Handler` — load RA by
  name/ns, walk `api[]` in `topologicalSort` order, classify each stage
  (`createRequestOptions` → `ParseAPIServerPathToDep` for in-cluster GET; `discoveryClientFor`
  on SA RC for bare discovery paths; UAF branch reads `uaf.Group`/`uaf.Verb`/resource-set),
  dedupe+sort the triples, marshal §4 shape, fail-loud on non-200 discovery.
- `main.go` (~5 LOC at the §5 mount site, adjacent to main.go:818): mount `GET /rbac` on
  `UserConfig`; **do not** `RegisterScopedRoute`.
- **Dropped vs prior draft**: `serviceauth.go` (entire file) — not created.
- Net: ~280 LOC → ~185 LOC after dropping the middleware.

---

## 7. Falsifiers (consolidated; PM re-gate checklist)

1. **UAF verb emit (§4):** RA with UAF `verb: deletecollection` on `namespaces` →
   `/rbac` readSet contains `{group:"", resource:"namespaces", verb:"deletecollection"}`.
   Verb-less/omitted = FAIL.
2. **Non-UAF verb:** plain in-cluster GET stage on `/api/v1/namespaces` → row
   `{group:"", resource:"namespaces", verb:"get"}`.
3. **resourcesFrom fan-out:** UAF with `resourcesFrom` yielding 3 plurals → 3 rows, each
   carrying `uaf.Verb` + `uaf.Group`.
4. **Auth reuse (§5):** a request with the **same** JWT+clientconfig that succeeds on `/call`
   succeeds on `/rbac`; a request with no/invalid Authorization header → 401 (UserConfig
   `:135-158`). No new key needed.
5. **Dispatch-free / before-resolve:** `/rbac` returns a correct read-set when the caller holds
   **zero** RBAC on the enumerated GVRs (enumeration under SA discovery; the caller's
   clientconfig is loaded but never used for the reads).
6. **Not scoped:** `AssertReadPathsScoped` / `requiredScopedRoutes`
   (`fallthrough_assert.go`) startup assertion still passes with `/rbac` mounted and
   un-registered (mirrors `/refreshes`).

---

## 8. Strategic choice surfaced (one)

**Oracle restriction** (§5): default `UserConfig` (any authenticated caller) vs optional
core-provider-group check. **Recommendation: default `UserConfig`** per Diego — the leak is
read-only blueprint metadata already obtainable via `GET` on the RA CR; add the group check
only on a concrete need. Everything else in this design is non-strategic and TRACED.
