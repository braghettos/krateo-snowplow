// resolved_keepwarm_reresolve_test.go — #102 GTTL c1 the RE-RESOLVE-NOT-EXTEND
// crux (design §1.1-1.2 + the design-gate HARD invariant): the keep-warm sweep
// must RE-RESOLVE (fresh bytes via a genuine Put, which slides CreatedAt),
// NEVER lease-renew / touch CreatedAt without fresh content. These arms pin the
// load-bearing STORE semantics the whole c1 design rests on, so a future edit
// that tried a CreatedAt-touch shortcut would go RED here.
//
// Store-level + hermetic (newResolvedCache, backdated CreatedAt) — mirrors
// resolved_catalog_ttl_test.go. No cluster.

// at TTL. This is exactly why the sweep must RE-RESOLVE, not lease-renew.
//
// DETERMINISTIC (no sleep-timing races): two assertions, both on backdated
// CreatedAt like resolved_catalog_ttl_test.go —
//   (1) a Get NEVER changes CreatedAt (read the entry pointer's CreatedAt before
//       and after a HIT — they must be identical); AND
//   (2) reading a cell whose CreatedAt is already backdated PAST the TTL is a
//       MISS (lazy-on-Get eviction) — the read does not rescue it.
// The crux MUTATION (make Get slide CreatedAt, a lease-renewal touch) FAILS arm
// (1) directly (CreatedAt changes on read) and arm (2) if the slide precedes the
// expiry check — either way RED, with no wall-clock dependence.
