// stage_error_sink.go — Ship 0.30.120: the error-aware Put-gate seam.
//
// THE DEFECT (pre-existing since 0.30.113): the SA-transport L1
// refresher re-resolves a whole RESTAction with no per-user JWT. A
// stage with exportJwt:true makes a nested snowplow /call loopback that
// needs the user's bearer token; without it the loopback 401s. The
// stage's continueOnError swallows the 401 as a STRUCTURALLY-VALID empty
// result — the resolver writes call.ErrorKey into its dict, the
// top-level RESTAction filter strips that key before encode, and the
// refresher Puts a ~1.9 KB empty envelope over the user's correct
// ~26 MB entry. Uniform under-serve, not a leak.
//
// WHY A CONTEXT SINK (architect's load-bearing finding): the error
// SIGNAL is gone by the time the bytes are encoded — the RESTAction's
// top-level filter strips the error key, and a generic JSON walk for a
// field named "error" would false-positive on legitimate fields. The
// signal MUST be read PRE-filter, at the moment the resolver writes
// dict[call.ErrorKey]. WithStageErrorSink threads an *atomic.Int64 down
// the resolve context; the resolver's three ErrorKey-write sites bump it
// when a sink is present; resolveAndPopulateL1 reads Load()>0 before its
// Put and declines to overwrite the prior good entry (TTL is the outer
// net). On the normal request path no sink is installed — Load is never
// called, Add is never called, the diff is byte-identical and zero-cost.
//
// Mirrors WithL1KeyContext / L1KeyFromContext (deps.go): a distinct
// unexported empty-struct key so external packages cannot collide via a
// raw string key.
