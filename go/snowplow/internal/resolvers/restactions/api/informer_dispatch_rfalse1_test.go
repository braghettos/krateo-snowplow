// informer_dispatch_rfalse1_test.go — Tag 0.30.98 falsifier F4 (R-FALSE-1),
// re-framed for the #57 implicit-on-cache fold.
//
// R-FALSE-1 (architect falsifier, carried since the 0.30.95 pivot): when
// the pivot is inactive, the binary's pivot path is byte-identical to the
// apiserver path — the resolver NEVER routes a read through the informer
// cache, and therefore never reaches the 0.30.98 four-conjunct servability
// gate (IsServable / ListObjectsServable).
//
// #57 — the pivot was gated by the standalone RESOLVER_USE_INFORMER flag;
// that flag was folded into the single CACHE_ENABLED master gate. The
// resolve.go consumer gate is now:
//
//	if resolverUseInformer() {   // == !cache.Disabled()
//	    if raw, served := dispatchViaInformer(gctx, call); served { ... }
//	}
//
// So "pivot inactive" is now exactly "cache subsystem OFF". Cache-OFF is
// the byte-identity path the falsifier guards. (This is independent of —
// and in addition to — the get.go:51 / Gate-4 cache.Disabled() short-
// circuits; here we pin the CONSUMER GATE itself.)
//
// Why this test lives HERE and not in internal/cache: R-FALSE-1 is a
// property of the GATED CONSUMER, not of the servability predicate. The
// predicate is pure and has no gate read.
//
// dispatchViaInformer is the ONLY function in the resolver that calls
// IsServable / ListObjectsServable. Every path through dispatchViaInformer
// increments exactly one pivot counter (ListServed | GetServed |
// Fallthrough) — see informer_dispatch_metrics.go. So "the dispatch path
// did not reach the servable gate" is observable as "the pivot counters
// did not move".
//
// This test asserts the true behavioral surface:
//
//   - NEGATIVE control: with the cache subsystem OFF, the resolve.go gate
//     (resolverUseInformer()) evaluates false, dispatchViaInformer is not
//     invoked, and the pivot counters stay frozen — the servable gate is
//     unreachable. A stale RESOLVER_USE_INFORMER=true is IGNORED (the fold
//     means cache-off closes the gate regardless).
//   - POSITIVE control: with the cache subsystem ON, the gate passes,
//     invoking dispatchViaInformer DOES move a counter — proving the
//     counter is a faithful witness of the gate being reached, so the
//     negative control's "counters frozen" is meaningful.
//
// Per feedback_no_special_cases.md: the assertion uses the generic
// dispatchTestGVR; no per-resource branching.
