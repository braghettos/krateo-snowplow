## The decision (2025-10-22)

Snowplow depends on the `authn` service for authentication and Bearer-token
issuance; standing up `authn` (its setup and CRDs) just to test snowplow was
fragile and slow. The decision: perform a one-time user registration and token
generation with the **shared authentication library**, without deploying
`authn` — originally via the `krateoctl add-user` CLI command.

## Current state (verified against the tree)

The *decoupling* stands and is how snowplow is tested and quick-started today;
the *tool* has changed:

- Snowplow validates tokens entirely in-process: a Krateo access token is a
  plain **HS256 JWT** signed with the `JWT_SIGN_KEY` snowplow is started with
  (`main.go` — `middleware.UserConfig(*signKey, *authnNS)`), carrying
  `username` and `groups` claims. The shape is defined by the shared auth
  library (`github.com/krateo-platformops/plumbing` `jwtutil` —
  `CreateToken` / `Validate`). No `authn` deployment is needed to obtain or
  validate one.
- `krateoctl` is **not published under the `krateo-platformops` org** and is
  not referenced anywhere in this tree. The supported tool-free path is the
  inline mint in [`install.md`](install.md) §4 (a stdlib-only Python HS256
  signer producing the same token the shared library would).

## Consequences (unchanged)

- **Simplified testing:** services that depend on authentication are testable
  independently of `authn`.
- **Reduced operational overhead:** no need to deploy or maintain `authn` in
  local or CI environments.
- **Consistency:** the token shape is the shared library's, so hand-minted
  tokens are compatible with real authentication flows.
- **Admin utility:** the same mechanism bootstraps users for quickstarts.
